            Hello, my name is Danielle Midulla.
            <br /><br />
            I was born and raised in New York City and am fluent in both English and French.
            <br /><br />
            I graduated from Dartmouth College in June 2017 with a Computer Science major and a Theater minor.
            <br /><br />
            When I'm not on campus, I am an avid fisherwoman and like to knit and crochet.
            <br /><br />
            While on campus, during the winter term, I was a ski instructor for the PE Department.
            I also worked as a developer at the Digital Arts, Leadership, & Innovation Lab (DALI) Lab.
            <br /><br />
            I really enjoyed working at DALI because it allowed me to work on interesting and challenging projects in a collaborative environment.
            <br /><br />
            DALI also gave me an amazing (and comfortable) environment in which to hang out and code with people who share my interests.
            <br /><br />

            The Office Hours app was built as a final project for <em>Computer Science 052 - Full-Stack Web Development</em>.
            It was built with Tyler Burnam, Clement Nyanhongo, Joshua Utterback, and Sidney Wijngaarde.
            The result of this project can be found <a href="http://officehoursapp.surge.sh/" target="_blank">here</a>.
          </p><p>
            The purpose of this project was to help make TA lab hours more efficient.
            In many Computer Science classes at Dartmouth, during TA hours,
            people sit cramped in a stuffy basement room with no windows and write their names in a queue on the blackboard that ends up with arrows pointing all over the place.
            Another problem that people have with attending office hours is not knowing when they are occurring because the schedule changes at the last second.
            So, we built a website where students could manage their classes' office hours and review their schedules.
            Additionally, they can see the publicly posted questions from each TA session and the current queue of people waiting to speak to a TA.
          </p><p>
            On this project, in addition to coding various parts of both the front-end and the API, I worked in a bit of an organizational position.
            I set up the continuous integration with Travis as well as the automatic deployments and wrote large sections of the documentation.
            Additionally, I was the one who submitted the assignments for each of the weekly milestones and made sure that my teammates did their parts.

            This project was done as part of my work at the DALI Lab.
            The other developers on the project were Odon (Eddy) Orzsik during the Fall term and Kristie Chow and Alex Chan during the Winter term.
            The result of this project can be found <a href="http://changing-perspectives.surge.sh/" target="_blank">here</a>.

            The purpose of this project was to build an interface for student in K-8 to be able to experience different disabilities.
            The website is supposed to work in conjunction with the existing curriculum used by Changing Perspectives and found at <a href="http://cpne.org/">http://cpne.org/</a>.
          </p><p>
            During my first term on the project, I built the front-end of the project using React.
            As the only developer on the project for two terms, during the second term, I worked in a leadership position,
            overseeing the changes that the new developers were making to the front-end while spearheading the work on building an entire back-end API in ExpressJS with mongoDB.

            This project was done for <em>COSC 098 - Senior Design and Implementation Project</em> as my culminating experience for my major in Computer Science.
            It was a group project with Sean Cann, Eric Chen, Edrei Chua, Caleb (Junmo) Kim, and Chi Pham.
            The result of this project can be found <a href="https://mappit.me/" target="_blank">here</a>.
          </p><p>
            The purpose of the project was to create a different system to handle events as many people can have trouble with event information coming in a text format.
            <em>Mappit</em> solves this problem by presenting the events on a map similar to how airbnb presents their available locations.
            The map allows people to easily view the events currently occurring near them.
          </p><p>
            I worked mostly on front-end logic for this project.
            After helping to set up the main React structure, I also implemented Redux and became the point person of the group on all things React and Redux.
            I also helped to set up a lot of the styling, including the use of material-ui React components.

                This project was built during my work at the DALI lab at the request of a research group on campus.
                We built the kiosk on the left which recorded the responses of hundreds of responses a day to a question about students' emotional health.
              </p><p>
                I joined the project in its final term at Dartmouth.
                My main contribution was to work on updating the code base so that it can be generalized to more than one question as well as restyling the page.
                Additionally, I added in integrations with the Giphy API so that, after responding, users were presented with a gif of a cute animal,
                hopefully incentivizing the use of the kiosk and calming the more stressed users.
                Finally, I added the functionality to save the results from the daily button clicks and automatically upload them to GitHub at the end of each day.
